Krishna Senthil,How to select the apt value for gamma in reinforcement learning.,2020-09-28T05:17:20Z,0,1
edureka!,"Typically, gamma is viewed as part of the problem, not of the algorithm. A reinforcement learning algorithm tries for each state to optimise the cumulative discounted reward:

r1 + gamma*r2 + gamma^2*r3 + gamma^3*r4 ... 

where rn is the reward received at time step n from the current state. So, for one choice of gamma the algorithm may optimise one thing, and for another choice it will optimise something else.
However, when you have defined a certain high-level goal, there still often remains a modelling choice, as many different gamma's might satisfy the requirements of the goal.

In general, most algorithms learn faster when they don't have to look too far into the future. So, it sometimes helps the performance to set gamma relatively low. A general rule of thumb might be: determine the lowest gamma min_gamma that still satisfies your high-level goal, and then set the gamma to gamma = (min_gamma + 1)/2.

Hope that solves your query.",2020-10-20T11:47:12Z,0,

3. The CONTENT of the slides are EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE.
4. The SPEED at which the course is progressing is JUST RIGHT.
